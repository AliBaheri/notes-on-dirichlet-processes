I taught myself Dirichlet processes and Hierarchal DPs in the spring of 2015 in order to understand nonparametric Bayesian models and related inference algorithms. In the process, I wrote a bunch of code and took a bunch of notes; later, I turned these into [blog posts](http://stiglerdiet.com/category/nonparametric-bayes.html).
